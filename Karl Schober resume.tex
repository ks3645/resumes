% IMPORTANT: THIS TEMPLATE NEEDS TO BE COMPILED WITH XeLaTeX
%
% This template uses several fonts not included with Windows/Linux by
% default. If you get compilation errors saying a font is missing, find the line
% on which the font is used and either change it to a font included with your
% operating system or comment the line out to use the default font.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 
% TODO:
% 1. Integrate biber/bibtex for article citation under publications.
% 2. Figure out a smoother way for the document to flow onto the next page.
% 3. Add styling information for a "Projects/Hacks" section.
% 4. Add location/address information
% 5. Merge OpenFont and MacFonts as a single sty with options.
% 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% CHANGELOG:
% v1.1:
% 1. Fixed several compilation bugs with \renewcommand
% 2. Got Open-source fonts (Windows/Linux support)
% 3. Added Last Updated
% 4. Move Title styling into .sty
% 5. Commented .sty file.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Known Issues:
% 1. Overflows onto second page if any column's contents are more than the
% vertical limit
% 2. Hacky space on the first bullet point on the second column.

			\item Scaled hybrid human/AI chatbot product, Ana, to cover total addressable market  (up from a previous max of 1000 daily active users) with reliability over >99.99\% by refactoring critical components.
			\item Implemented fuzzy matching algorithms and designed ethical AI for intent detection
			 which increased response automation for messages from 20\% to 45\% while retaining perfect QOS for end-users.
			\item Led initiatives for better project level documentation and code standards to improve engineering practices. 
			\item Led development for project to update proprietary backend framework from .NET Framework 4.5 to LTS .NET Core in order to achieve cross platform support, reduce server costs, increase performance, and ensure stability and security
			\item Led project to implement security best practices and meet compliance standards for TX-RAMP and SOC2

		\begin{tightemize}
			\item Backend developer for LoadRunner, a proprietary C\#/WPF application for managing 3rd party logistics workflow. Focused on architecture and API improvements leveraging functional programming paradigms
			\item Designed a new search engine, providing 100x faster searches for users and a more scalable back-end implementation
			\item Designed a new document generation framework to replace Crystal Reports for generating business documents. This allowed designers to work with a more accessible HTML template interface, and provided a more easily understandable framework for developers to add future document models.
			\item Improved engineering practices by contributing to more detailed code standards and pushing for better testing and deployment procedures
